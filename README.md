# Image-Caption-Generator-Using-LSTM
Trained a deep learning model to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. The project used a CNN to extract features from images, which were then fed into an LSTM-based RNN to generate a textual description. The model was trained and validated using the Flickr8k dataset, demonstrating proficiency in computer vision and NLP.
